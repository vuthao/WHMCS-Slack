# WHMCS-Slack
This was originally sold by via Anveto but I have decided to make it free and open source the addon. You are free to contribute and use the code as long as you give credit to me and abide by the MIT license.

If you have purchased this script previously and need support please contact me for premium support. If you are using the free version of this script please open an issue.
